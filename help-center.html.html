            <h3>>>View and Track Your Goals:</h3><br>

            #Here, you can monitor each goalâ€™s progress, view details, and adjust them as needed.<br><br>
            <h3>>>Edit or Update Goals:</h3><br>

            # In the Income Tracker section, start by entering your income amount in the provided form and <br>click "Add Income".<br>

            <h3>>>Monitor Remaining Balance:</h3><br>

            <h3>>>Visualize Expenses with Charts:</h3><br>
            The tracker includes a pie chart of your expenses, making it easy to see how much you <br>spend in each category at a glance.
